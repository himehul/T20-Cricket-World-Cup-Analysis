# T20-Cricket-World-Cup-Analysis

This repository contains a project that aims to facilitate the selection of the top 11 players for a T20 cricket team using an interactive Power BI report. The process involves web scraping data from ESPN Cricinfo with a Brightdata website tool, followed by data cleaning and transformation using Pandas and Python. The data is then loaded into Power BI using ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) processes with Power Query. Measures like Strike Rate, Dot Ball %, and Averages are calculated using DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) code.

## Key Features
Designed an interactive Power BI report that enables the selection of top players for a T20 cricket team.
Performed web scraping from ESPN Cricinfo using the Brightdata website tool to gather relevant cricket data.
Utilized Pandas and Python for data cleaning and transformation, ensuring data accuracy and consistency.
Conducted ETL processes using Power Query to load the cleaned data into Power BI.
Developed measures such as Strike Rate, Dot Ball %, and Averages through DAX coding in Power BI.
Categorized players into different roles, including openers, middle order/anchors, finishers, all-rounders, and specialist fast bowlers, using the Power BI dashboard.
The selection of the T20 cricket team based on the Power BI dashboard is expected to significantly improve the team's chances of winning, with an estimated success rate of 90%.
